### Introduction 
youâ€™ll build a web app with a simple UI where a user can sign up for an account. Once logged in, the user is presented with a simple form to add medicine name, dosages, and frequency. After adding those details, the user can view, edit, or delete this information. The rough estimate for this project is 20 hours.
